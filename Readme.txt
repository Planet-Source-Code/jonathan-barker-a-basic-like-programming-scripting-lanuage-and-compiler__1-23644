Readme for BASIC(ish) interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The program compiles straight away with VB. To run it in the IDE set
Project->Project1 Properties->'Make' tab->Command Line Arguments to:

	debug

and the program will start properly in the IDE.

By default the program will load the prog.txt program.

Making EXEs
~~~~~~~~~~~

To make an exe simply compile lang.exe, and copy it to prog.exe (in the
same folder). Then run 'lang.exe debug' and click 'Make EXE'. That should be it!

(or just click on makeprog.bat)

Just click on prog.exe to see if it works...
